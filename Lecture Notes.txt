Video 2: Introduction to Flexbox
    display: flex; goes all the way and uses the entire page width.
    display: inline-flex; just takes the amount of width needed.
    The immediate children of the display: flex container makes the children flex items.

Video 3: Working with Flexbox flex-direction
    flex-direction: row; is the default for any flex container.
    this means that they will stack beside each other in a row and span the height specified.
    The main axis when flex-direction: row is from left to right. While the cross axis is from top to bottom.
    The main axis when flex-direction: column is from top to bottom. While the cross axis is from left to right.
    Similarly flow-direction: row-reverse and column-reverse work in an opposite manner.
    
Video 4: Wrapping elements with Flexbox
    The flex items try to work with the width given but if it is not possible it distributes them with an equal width.
    flex-wrap goes on the flex container. The default is nowrap
    flex-wrap: wrap wraps the extra elements in a new line/row.
    The height is automatically adjusted so as to maintain the splitting and occupying the height.
    flex-wrap: wrap-reverse; The cross axis changes from top->bottom to bottom->top
    margin is not part of the width, height etc when it comes to flex items and containers.
    padding and border are part of the box model while margin is not.

Video 5: Flexbox Ordering
    flex: 1; distributes every items equally.
    order: 0; by default.
    so any order numeral except 0 will put it at the end after all the order: 0; items.
    order can have negative values also.
    The only caveat is that it messes the mouse selector.

Video 6: Flexbox Alignment and Centering with justify-content
    Very Useful: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/
    justify-content deals with the alignment of the items along the Main Axis.
    flex-start is the default option.
    flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around(also considers space on left and right), space-evenly
    to take advantage of justify-content when the main axis is from top to bottom, we need to set a minimum height.
